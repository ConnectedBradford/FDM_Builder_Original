    "# Building FDMs in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is an interactive tutorial, looking at the python `FDMBuilder` API which, as the name suggests, builds FDMs. This tutorial covers the basics, with an explanation of most of the key python concepts from first principles, so the workflow should hopefully be understood and, with a bit of practice, usable by folks that have never touched python in the past. A second tutorial notebook `fdm_builder_extras_tutorial` covers additional functionality that will hopefully be useful to those more comfortable with python and the FDM process. It is still, however, worth running through this tutorial first no matter your experience, as it lays out a lot of the basics of the FDMBuilder pipeline and workflow, that aren't covered in the extras tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's hoped that the pipeline covered in this notebook should significantly speed up a lot of the FDM building workflow by removing a lot of the repetitive and boring scripting, with the added benefit of making it significantly less error prone.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quick Jupyter notebooks primer\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, we'll need a quick introduction of the Jupyter notebook environment. Otherwise, we're not going to get very far with this tutorial. Folk familiar with Jupyter notebooks can skip this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "A jupyter notebook allows you to write markdown and execute python/R script in one document.  This text has been written in a markdown cell (double click right here, anywhere within this text, and you'll be able to edit the markdown). Running a markdown cell renders it (so displaying the markdown in it's non-scripted format).\n",
    "\n",
    "Immediately below this is the first code cell - it contains script that imports all of the required python libraries to run the FDMBuilder. Any output from a code cell will be displayed immediately below the cell once it has been run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Be sure to write text and documentation in a markdown cell, and script in a code cell - otherwise you'll get some pretty colourful errors when python/R tries to interpret your documentation!\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a bunch of controls to manage each cell in the notebook: the UI has buttons above that can run a code cell, change a code cell to a markdown cell or visa-versa, stop execution of a code cell, execute every cell in the notebook, and so on... Hover over each of the buttons above to see what they do. You can also perform all cell-related activities by selecting the `Cell` menu in the toolbar and choosing the relevant option.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, hotkeys are usually the easiest way to quickly run code cells (and render markdown). Simply select a code cell and:\n",
    "\n",
    "* press `ctrl+enter` to run the cell \n",
    "* press `shift+enter` to run the cell and move focus to the cell below\n",
    "* press `ctrl+shift+enter` to run the cell and create a new, empty code cell below\n",
    "\n",
    "That should be enough to get started - plenty of other online guides exist if you want to get better acquainted with the jupyter notebook environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Get started by running the below code cell, which imports all the required python libraries for the FDMBuilder - just click on the below cell to focus on it, then press `shift+enter` or click on the little \"play\" button above. You should note the a number appear in the square brackets, or if the cell has already been run, the number will change:\n"

    "\n",
    "The FDMBuilder library has been designed with the hope that a non-python user shouldn't (hopefully) have too much difficulty using the FDM tools to build a dataset from scratch. The workflow is split into two major steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prepare the individual source tables\n",
    "2. Build the FDM\n",
    "\n",
    "Each step comes with it's own tool or helper that walks through the process of preparing and bulding an FDM dataset. Source tables are \"built\" or prepared for the FDM process with the `FDMTable` tool - this is a python \"class\" that contains all the bits and pieces needed to clean and prep a table for FDMing. Once all the source tables are ready, the FDM dataset itself is \"built\" using the `FDMDataset` tool - another python class responsible for drawing all the source tables together and building the standard FDM tables (person and observation_period).\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll begin with the basics of using the FDMTable and FDMDataset tools to buld an FDM dataset. Once we're more comfortable with the python workflow, we can then move onto the more \"advanced\" functions that can streamline many of the more common cleaning/manipulation activities that pop up during the FDM process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## FDMTable\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin the FDM process, we need to prep each source table. This process ensures that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The source table is copied to the FDM dataset location\n",
    "2. person_ids are added to each entry\n",
    "3. An event_start_date is added to each entry in a cleaned `DATETIME` format\n",
    "4. If needed an event_end_date is added to each entry in a cleaned `DATETIME` format\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this using the python FDMBuilder, you first need to define an individual FDMTable object for each of the source tables in your FDM dataset. We can do just that by running the code cell below:\n"

    "\n",
    "Initialising the `FDMTable` class doesn't actually do anything particularly substantive - it just creates and stores an object in python. To start working with the tool, you need to run or \"call\" one of the `FDMTable`'s \"methods\". Methods are functions attached to a specific class, that update/manipulate/otherwise mess about with the related class object. So the `FDMTable` class has methods that manipulate the associated table in GCP doing things like adding/deleting/renaming columns and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, we'll look at the most of important of these methods `build` - fortunately it's also the easiest to get to grips with.

If at any point you want to start over with a fresh empty test dataset, just run the code cell below.
